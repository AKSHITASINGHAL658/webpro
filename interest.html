I am deeply interested in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) because they combine intelligent decision-making with real-world connectivity. I enjoy exploring how smart systems can learn from data, automate tasks, and make everyday life more efficient. IoT fascinates me because it connects devices in a way that allows seamless communication and control, while AI adds the power of prediction and adaptability. Together, these technologies inspire me to work on innovative solutions that can improve user experience, solve practical problems, and contribute to a smarter and more connected future.
